\title{Subsidiary PowerLATE Function}
\usage{
unequal.ordered(
  power = NULL,
  sig.level = NULL,
  pi = NULL,
  kappa = NULL,
  N = NULL,
  pZ = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{power}{power of test (1 minus Type II error probability)}

\item{sig.level}{significance level (Type I error probability).}

\item{pi}{compliance rate. Equivalently, average causal effect of Z on D.}

\item{kappa}{effect size}

\item{N}{total number of observations}

\item{pZ}{probability of being assigned to treatment.}
}
\value{
A vector of values for one in \{kappa, N, power\} that is not supplied by the user.
}
\description{
Subsidiary function to perform power calculation under unequal assignment probability and ordered mean assumption.
}
\note{
This function is called internally and thus should not be used directly.
